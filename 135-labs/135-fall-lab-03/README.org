* Specific instructions for lab 03

** Overall changes

For this lab, you will create a program with multiple files and us
~make~ to control compilation. There will be a sample ~Makefile~ along
with other starter files in this repo. Use the Makefiles we created
in class and are currently in classcode as samples and references.

In addition to adding your ~.cpp~ files to the repo make sure to add
the reservoir level *tsv* file you downloaded as well.


** Task A

Write a program that consists of two .cpp files plus any supporting
files. One will be named ~main.cpp~ and it will drive your
program. It will contain the ~main~ function. The other file should be
named ~reservoir.cpp~ and should contain a function with the prototype
~double get_east_storage(std::string date)~.

The ~get_east_storage~ function should accept a std::string specifying a
date and should return the East Basin storage for that day. Your
program should call and test this function from main. There should be
no keyboard input but the output should illustrate that the function
works correctly.

*Note:* This assignment template contains a skeleton that includes the
 Makefile, main.cpp, and reservoir.h and reservoir.cpp. You are
 expected to fill in the functions and calls.

*Note:* The get_east_storage function should open and read the data
file.

** Task B

Add the following two functions to ~reservoir.cpp/h~

1. double get_min_east() - this function should return the minimum
   storage in the East basin in the 2018.
2. double get_max_east() - this function should return the maximum
   storage in the East basin in the 2018.

Test these by calling them from main and printing out results. As with
task A, there should be no keyboard input. 

*Note:* Like in Task A, you will have to read the file completely in
these functions.

** Task C

Add a function ~std::string compare_basins(std::string date)~ that 
will return ~East~ if the East basin was higher on the specified date
and ~West~ if the West was higher. It should return ~Equal~ if the
values were the same.

As with the other tasks, this function should read in the file and
there should be no keyboard input. Remember to test sufficiently from
main.


** Task D

For this task, add new files, ~reverseorder.cpp~ and
~reverseorder.h~. You will have to modify the ~Makefile~
appropriately. 

In these files create a function ~void reverse_oreder(std::string
date1, std::string date2)~. This function should print out the West
basin elevation for all days in the interval in reverse chronological
order.

Test from main.
