* Specific instructions 

Add a new function using the signature ~std::string
solve(std::string encrypted_string)~ that will use the techniques we discussed in class
to decode the parameter ~encrypted_string~. That string will be text
that has been encoded using the Caesar cipher you already wrote. 

The ~solve~ function should:
1. For each of the 26 rotations of encrypted string: 
   1. Make a 26 space vector with the frequencies of all the letters
      based on *encrypted_string*. Note that entries will be 0 for
      letters that don't appear in the input string.
    2. Calculate the distance between this vector and the vector of
       letter frequencies for English.
The rotation with the smallest distance should be the solution.

You can add additional functions and place all functionality in files
that make sense (and/or add new ones). 

You should use doctest based tests to show that this works.
