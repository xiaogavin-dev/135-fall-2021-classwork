* Specific instructions for lab 04

For this lab, you will have to create a ~Makefile~ to build your
project. It should create a single executable named ~main~. Use the
Makefile from lab 03 as reference. The ~main~ function should call all
the functions that accomplish the tasks. Those functions may not be
written in ~main.cpp~ but rather you should create at least one
additional ~.cpp/.h~ file(s).

Write a function for each of the tasks. The functions should accept
parameters for the assorted dimensions and should return a std::string
with a string representing the output. Recall that you can embed a
newline ~\n~ in a string to move to the next line. 

The main function should call each task function one or more times and
print out the results to show that everything works.

For example, for task A you might write a routine with a prototype
~std::string box(int width, int height)~.

You might test it from main as follows:

#+begin_src c++

// more code up here

std::string result;
result = box(3,5);
std::cout << "box(3,5):\n";
std::cout << result
std::cout << "\n------------------\n"; // seperator 

// more tests to show that box works fully could be added

// more code down here

#+end_src

*Note:* Remember that your program should not ask for any keyboard
 input. When run it should clearly show that all tasks are implemented
 and work.
