* Specific instructions for lab 05

This lab requires that you implement doctest based tests. There is
already a skeleton ~Makefile~ with targets for ~main~ and ~tests~ as
well as skeleton ~.c~ ~.h~ and ~doctest.h~ files. 

For each function specified in the main lab, add the code to ~funcs.h~
and ~funcs.cpp~. You should call them from ~main~ but you also need to
put in tests into ~tests.cpp~. 

I will test ~main~ but will only consider ~tests.cpp~ to determine if
your functions area all working properly. You will have to make
sensible decisions based on the assignment as to how many tests you
need and what you should test for.

For reference, the doctest package and documentation can be found
[[https://github.com/onqtam/doctest][here]].



*Note:* Remember that your program (including tests) should not ask
 for any keyboard input. When run it should clearly show that all
 tasks are implemented and work.
